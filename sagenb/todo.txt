Current TODO:
[ ] getting output as it appears
[ ] worksheet_process.py -- make it so graphics work, i.e., files created
[ ] use multiprocessing 


General TODO:

[ ] make sure all "/" is replaced by os.path.join, so will work on windows eventually.

* component architecture: see Brickenstein sage-devel email 
  that mentions http://python-rum.org/browser/rum/component.py

* use memory mapped files for worksheet processes?
